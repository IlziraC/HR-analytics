## Overview

I utilized Python to generate HR data set and analyze it in Power BI, to achieve a visually appealing dashboard that effectively highlights trends.

## Creating Fake Data

I leveraged the power of Python's 'faker' package to generate comprehensive HR data for the year 2023. This repository contains the scripts for generating random employee data using `Generate_random_employee_data.py` and 12 CSV reports for the year 2023.

## Data Analysis in Power BI

Once the data was generated, it was seamlessly imported into Power BI using the `HR Project.pbix` file. The journey of data refinement began with a process of cleaning, combining, and categorizing the dataset in the Query Editor to ensure its accuracy and relevance.

## Data Modeling and Analysis

With the data primed for analysis, I proceeded to create a data model, calculated columns, and measures, deploying data analytics expressions (DAX) to derive meaningful insights.

## Dashboard Overview

The culmination of this effort resulted in the development of a visually appealing dashboard with 3 pages:

This dashboard stands out as a powerful tool for highlighting key trends within the HR landscape.

## Repository Structure

- `Generate_random_employee_data.py`: Python script for generating random employee data.
- `HR Project.pbix`: Power BI file containing the data model and dashboard.

## Usage

1. Run `Generate_random_employee_data.py` to generate random employee data.
2. Alternatively, download the 12 CSV reports for the year 2023.
3. Import the generated data into Power BI using `HR Project.pbix`.
4. Explore the data model, calculated columns, and measures.
5. View and analyze the HR dashboard with key insights.
